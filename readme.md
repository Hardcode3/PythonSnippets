# 🐍 Python Snippets Collection

A personal repository to store small Python snippets, experiments, and things I learn along the way.
This is mostly for my own reference — a kind of digital notebook — but if anything here helps someone else, that’s great too!

## 📘 About

This repo is a growing collection of:

- Small, self-contained Python examples
- Reusable patterns and idioms
- Notes from books, talks, or tutorials
- Explorations of the Python standard library and beyond

I use it as a place to:

- Keep track of things I learn
- Revisit past ideas and code samples
- Gradually improve my Python skills through iteration and curiosity

## 🧩 Structure

Each snippet typically lives in its own `.py` file and focuses on one topic or concept.
Examples might include:

- vector_class.py
- deck_of_cards.py
- dataclass_examples.py
- asyncio_notes.py

## 🧠 Philosophy

- **Learning by doing:** Every snippet represents a small learning step.
- **Clarity over cleverness:** Code should be simple and readable.
- **No pressure:** This isn’t a library — just a sandbox for exploration.

## ⚖️ License

Just note that this repository’s primary goal is **personal learning**, not public maintenance.
